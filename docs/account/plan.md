# Introduction

D2C does not provide its computing resources – it automates the provisioning process at cloud providers. Be aware that [cloud provider](/providers/cloud-providers/) will charge you for resource usage based on your payment plan.

### Notes

1. Priority in task queue means how fast task (create services, update services, etc.) will be processed. If you would like to manage priority yourself, you need the Enterprise plan.
2. You can change paid plan to Free after your subscription is expired and automatic payment is cancelled. The account should not have any hosts.
3. We never delete any data from your hosts after cancelling a subscription. You can continue to manage them manually.
4. You can ask to delete any data about your D2C account.

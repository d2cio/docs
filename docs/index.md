# Welcome to the D2C.io docs!

## What is D2C.io?
D2C is a platform which automates routines in building the infrastructure for applications. It is designed to facilitate DevOps' tasks for developers through the simple interface. You can use it to manage servers infrastructure and lifecycle of an application from developing to production using own hosts or cloud providers of your choice.

## Installation
D2C is hosted in the cloud, and you do not need to install anything. [Sign Up](https://panel.d2c.io/register) and start creating hosts and services which your application needs.

## What can you do with D2C.io?
- [**Containerize**](/getting-started/services/#introduction) applications (it happens automatically after creating any service)
- [**Deploying**](/platform/deployment/) applications from git or any archive to your cloud or own hosts
- [**Scaling**](/platform/scaling/) in a single click:
    - web-apps
    - databases (including replication)
    - hosts
- [**Balancing**](/platform/balancing/) applications using pre-configured HAProxy service
- [**Migrating**](/platform/migration/) containers to any of your hosts
- Check [**logs**](/platform/logs/) and [**metrics**](/platform/metrics/) of containers and hosts
- Use pre-configured [**private network**](/platform/private-network/) for all applications
- Use pre-configured **NGINX configs**
- Use [**free SSL**](/platform/domains-and-certificates/) certificates for your domains by Let's Encrypt (works with NGINX and HAProxy)

## How to get started?
- Create an account
- Link to a cloud provider or connect own hosts
- Create a project
- Choose services you want to deploy
- Configure (in a simple way, without any files)
- Select hosts and deploy
- Work on your code and use the interface for updating your app, checking metrics and logs
